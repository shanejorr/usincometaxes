  title: An R package to calculate federal and state income taxes in the United States
  description: >
    `usincometaxes` is an R package that calculates federal and state income taxes in the United States.
    It acts as a wrapper to the NBER's TAXSIM 35 (<http://taxsim.nber.org/taxsim35/>) tax simulator. TAXSIM 35 conducts
    the calculations, while 'usincometaxes' prepares the data for TAXSIM 35, sends the data to
    TAXSIM 35's server or communicates with the Web Assembly file, retrieves the data, and places it
    into a data frame. All without the user worrying about this process.

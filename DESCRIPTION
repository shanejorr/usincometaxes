Description: Calculates federal and state income taxes in the United States. It acts as 
    a wrapper to the NBER's TAXSIM 32 tax simulator. TAXSIM 32 conducts the calculations, while 
    usincometaxes prepares the data for TAXSIM 32, sends the data to TAXSIM 32's server, retrieves 
    the data, and places it into a data frame. All without the user worrying about this process.

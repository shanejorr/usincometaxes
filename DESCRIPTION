Description: Calculates federal and state income taxes in the United
    States. It acts as a wrapper to the NBER's TAXSIM 32 tax simulator.
    TAXSIM 32 conducts the calculations, while usincometaxes prepares the
    data for TAXSIM 32, sends the data to TAXSIM 32's server, retrieves
    the data, and places it into a data frame. All without the user
    worrying about this process.

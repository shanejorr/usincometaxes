`usincometaxes` returns tax results as a data frame, with each column representing tax information such as
federal and state income taxes owed or other line items. Each row corresponds to a row in the input data frame.
Users can specify the amount of output with the `return_all_information` parameter in `taxsim_calculate_taxes()`.
Setting `return_all_information` to `TRUE` returns a data frame with 51 columns of detailed tax information.
`FALSE` returns 8 columns of key information. `FALSE` leads to quicker calculations and downloads from the NBER's servers. 

`usincometaxes` provides the same output as [TAXSIM 35](http://taxsim.nber.org/taxsim35/). 
Setting `return_all_information` to `FALSE` equates to setting `idtl` to 0 in TAXSIM, while `TRUE` corresponds to 2.

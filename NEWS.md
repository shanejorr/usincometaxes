# usincometaxes 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- For ssh, create known_hosts file in temporary directory instead of .ssh.known_hosts. This is needed so that the package does not write to files outside the tempdir, in violation of CRAN requirements.
- For ssh, only use port 22.
- Merged from branch [update-ssh](https://github.com/shanejorr/usincometaxes/tree/update-ssh)

# usincometaxes 0.3.0
